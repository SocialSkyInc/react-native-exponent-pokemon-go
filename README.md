A simple [Pokemon Go](http://www.pokemongo.com/) clone, demonstrating the capabilities of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Exponent](https://getexponent.com/).

Utilizes maps, geolocation, camera, gyrometer, animation, and gesture handling to achieve
a basic demo of augmented reality similar to that in Pokemon Go.

By utilizing the [Exponent SDK](https://docs.getexponent.com/versions/v13.0.0/sdk/index.html#exponent-sdk), this app is compatible with both iOS and Android.

The simplest way to try it out on your device is to install Exponent from the
app store and open this project's link in Exponent:
